kkartikeysetia: add margin/spaces to every row

GitHub Copilot: To add margin or spacing to every row in your application, you can wrap the `Routes` component in a container `div` and apply a CSS class to it. Here's how you can modify your code:

### Updated App.jsx

```jsx
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import FormPage from "./components/FormPage";
import DisplayPage from "./components/DisplayPage";
import "./App.css"; // Component-specific styles

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app-container">
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<FormPage />} />
        <Route path="/display" element={<DisplayPage />} />
      </Routes>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Updated `App.css`

Add the following CSS rule to your `App.css` file to apply margin or spacing to every row:

```css
.app-container {
  margin: 20px; /* Adjust the value as needed */
}
```

This will ensure that all rows in your application have consistent spacing. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

GitHub Copilot: # React Form Validation

This project is a **React-based form validation application** that allows users to fill out a registration form with various fields, validates the input, and displays a success message upon successful submission. The form includes client-side validation for fields such as name, email, password, phone number, and more.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The form is styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive UI.
- **Client-Side Validation**: Validates user input for fields like email, password, phone number, PAN, and Aadhar.
- **Dynamic Dropdowns**: Country and city dropdowns are dynamically populated based on user selection.
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Users can toggle the visibility of the password field.
- **Success Popup**: Displays a success message upon successful form submission.
- **Routing**: Uses `react-router-dom` for navigation between the form page and the display page.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the UI.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation between pages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components.
- **JavaScript**: For form validation logic.
